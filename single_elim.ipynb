    "I'm the Vice President for the UCSD Women's Club Volleyball Team, and I grew tired of organizing tournaments in excel, so or my final project, I decided to create a program that will create the match-ups for a 16 team single elimination bracket. This bracket preserves each team's seed as assigned at the beginning of the tournament. Like in regular tournaments, it ensures that the first seed and the second seed are on opposite ends of the bracket and that good teams play bad teams in the initial stages of the tournament.\n",
